## HNG_Task 5 Chrome Extension
### The project is a screen recorder that receives videos, save it to a file and display all videos in the file.

## Endpoints:
#### The api has just 1 endpoint: 

##### /api/videos- This endpoint accepts both **GET** AND **POST** requests only.

##### The GET request (/api/videos) retrieves a list of all recorded videos and displays them.

##### The POST request (/api/videos) creates and saves a recorded video. It accepts the videos in chunks and appends them in a temporary file created.
##### After collecting all video chunks. It then stores them in a file in the directory.
